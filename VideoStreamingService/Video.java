     * Video Streaming Service
     * Suppose you are building a video streaming service. All videos are either TV series or movies.
     * Create an abstract class named Video and define the following properties and behaviors:
     * title: a String representing the title of the video
     * duration: an int representing the duration of the video in minutes
     * getInfo(): a method that returns a String containing all of the video's properties in a readable format
     * Create two classes that extend Video: TvSeries and Movie.
     * TvSeries objects should have an additional episodes property, an int representing the number of episodes in the
     * series.
     * Movie objects should have an additional rating property, a double representing the rating of the movie.
